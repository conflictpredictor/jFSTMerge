SemistructuredMerge is no longer a final class 
SemistructuredMergeâ€™s methods are no longer static
SemistructuredMerge now extends the Observable pattern, and has a method that checks for conflict markers after performing the textual merge, to notify the observers (mergescenario)
Semistructured merge has a mergecontext attribute
TextualMerge now has a new method to run diff3 on the files tuples with the same behavior of the merge method from the LineBasedMerger from featurehouse project
FSTMerge class contains an instance of SemistructuredMerge as attribute
FSTMerge class has new static attributes that represent diff3 conflict markers
The areFilesDifferent method from FilesManager class was altered so that only tuples of 3 identical files would be discarded by the mergefiles method from the JFSTMerge class
